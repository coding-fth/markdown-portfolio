I have had a passion for code in the past, however multiple job changes have distracted me from this and I am very rusty with most of these.

I really like *Scratch* as a coding language for young and old as it allows for playful interaction.

I have had **a lot** of fun in *Python* coding with this book [adventures in python book link](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Adventures+in+Minecraft%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119439585) 

I am brushing up on my *Javascript* with [this Javascript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/learn/lecture/13987588#questions/12862559)

Finally ... _I am very **impressed** with [this course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown?overlay=register-box-overlay)_
