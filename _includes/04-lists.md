# My favourite things

1. My family. My wife, eldest boy, little girl and littlest boy
2. The pets within the family, they sort of count as the above... We have a dog, three cats and a hamster.
3. Time out with the dog... it *can* get a little cluttered in the house at times
4. The quiet times when I can code on the raspberry pi and loud when jamming. 
5. Sci-fi

## This is because

- My family bring me joy
- The raspberry pi community have passion and kindness and a persistent learning spirit
- I used to prefer the quieter coding times but since 2020 has been crazy with lock downs I really miss the jams and regret every one that I missed.
